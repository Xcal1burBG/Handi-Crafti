# Handi-Crafti
This is a React application allowing freelancers, handicraft and handmade makers to offer, and consumers to choose among their services. 
Both types of users use same login and register form and can create offers as in my general belief every person has at least one kind of talent. 
That makes every user of the site creator after creating an offer. All registered and unregistered users can browse through the catalog of offers an choose any of them. 
Only registered users can create offer.
In the offer details can be seen its full description, email and phone to contact the creator, reviews from previous consumers and average rating of the creator, 
also list of images related to the offer.
Every creator can see his/her own offers, to edited and delite them, to add and remove photos, to change the main photo that appear in the catalog.
Every loged user can leave a review below the offer.
Average rating is related to the user, not the separate offer.
Once sent review can not be changed or deleted.
